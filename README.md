My 12th std School Project - AGON

“Agon” also known as “Queen’s Guard” is an abstract strategy game with perfect information 
(i.e. number random or unknown elements). “Agon” may be the two player oldest board game played 
on a hexagonally tiled board, first appearing as early as the late Eighteenth Century in “France”. 
The game reached the greatest popularity after hundred years later when the Victorians embraced it 
for its combination of simple moves and complex strategy.
